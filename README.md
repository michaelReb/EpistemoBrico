Epistemic bricolage and prototyping

Active projects:
* Digital epistemology for health: unguided patients and preventive care, patient-centric, e.g. using the Q-UEL/HDN stack developed by Barry Robson et al. (see the EpistemP4.v1.0_whitepaper...)
* Design of epistemic bricolage labs (see semantic field below)

Our semantic field for epistemic bricolage:
* Enabling creative prototyping (with epistemes)
* Bricolage across epistemologies
* Understand paradigm shifts (Kuhn), in science and beyond
* Open Science 2.0 = ?
* Beyond Kuhn: Michel Foucault and his legacy
* Cynefin: re-wilding, complex vs. complicated
* Bricoleur archetype (Levi-Strauss) and FabLab culture
* Extend the MakerSpace paradigm (make it epistemiologically richer?)
* Build epistemic bricolage labs

Learn from
* the history of innovation in different cultures
* MakerSpaces, FabLabs and similar communities
* transdisciplinary exemplars 


Collect ideas for the community build

* Open Science values (UNESCO)
* whitepaper on the Q-UEL/HDNs stack for building more flexible learning system prototypes e.g. for complexity in human health
* Python corner: code, e.g. for prototyping using the Q-UEL/HDN stack
* epistemic bricolage lab design (a new kind of MakerSpace?)
* open access digital library (avoid texts behind paywalls)
* knowledge, organized, reusable - for Epistemic Bricolage and similar prototyping outside classic paradigms

Epistemic Bricolage Labs: What is it about? Why do we need them?

We are entering an age of polycrisis: overlapping disruptions in health, climate, technology, geopolitics, demography, and institutional trust. Across domains, organizations are struggling not because they lack data or expertise, but because their cognitive infrastructures are ossified. All too often, they operate as rigid category-to-process systems: predefined classifications trigger standardized workflows, KPIs, and accountability structures optimized for yesterday’s world. When those categories were designed. 

  https://polycrisis.org is a European community of scholars and practitioners working on polycrisis and closely related topics

These organizational systems, bureaucracies in a broad sense, scale coordination of human work — but at the price of adaptability. When times change, anomalies accumulate, when cases no longer fit the old categories, the very structures that once ensured efficiency become epistemically blind. Such ossified institutions continue optimizing obsolete variables while reality shifts underneath them.

Historically, paradigm shifts have not been engineered from within such rigid systems. They have emerged from more flexible intellectual ecologies — spaces where heterogeneous knowledge, practice, play, and experimentation could recombine creatively, before formal theories and institutions caught up.

This is where epistemic bricolage becomes central. 

Bricolage is not improvisation as chaos. It is disciplined recombination: working with available materials, crossing boundaries, preserving anomalies rather than eliminating them, and prototyping new frames of understanding before they become formalized paradigms. It is how systems learn when established engineering logics fail.

Epistemic Bricolage Labs are proposed as modern infrastructures for this function: places where paradigm anomalies are gathered, recombined, tested, narrated, and translated into new models, practices, and prototype paradigms.

A historical exemplar clarifies the mechanism.

In 12th-century Al-Andalus, intellectual life was not organized into rigid disciplines or closed scholastic systems. Greek philosophy, Indian mathematics, older Middle Eastern science, Islamic theology, medicine, poetry, and law coexisted in a vibrant bricolage culture. In that intellectual ecology, algebra was an inspiring metaphor, allowing the playful recombination of all kinds of 'knowledge atoms' from different fields, once they were translated into a common language space. 

Here, Averroes, in the 12th century in Cordoba, became an example for transdisciplinary work using algebraic thinking and other forms of reasoning, similar to the logic used by modern sciences.

Averroes did not “invent” algebraic abstraction or Aristotelian rationalism in isolation. He operated inside a loose knowledge ecology where translation, commentary, debate, and cross-domain reasoning were normal. This environment allowed:

* preservation of contradictions rather than forced resolution
* recombination of symbolic systems (logic, law, medicine, mathematics)
* emergence of more abstract, formal modes of thought 

This epistemic looseness was not inefficiency — it was paradigm pre-formation. Prototyping across epistemologies. It prepared the ground for the European Renaissance and later scientific revolutions.

The lesson is structural: before new paradigms stabilize, societies need spaces where knowledge is not yet forced into rigid frames — where anomalies are explored rather than erased. Where such anomalies are embraced as inputs to what we may call 'epistemic bricolage'.


Epistemic Bricolage Labs aim to deliberately recreate something similar, a pre-paradigmatic ecology for today’s crises.



They combine:

* open science practices
* FabLab-style prototyping
* qualitative research methodologies such as Grounded Theory as tools
* collaborating with open-source communities
* learning from DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), e.g. vitaDAO
* learning from historical examples including the time of Averroes

into a single experimental knowledge commons.



Their purpose is not to optimize existing systems, within the frames they built, but to grow new frames of understanding and prototype use.

Here

* Scientific data meets lived experience
* Engineering meets anthropology
* Formal models meet narrative sensemaking
* History meets prototyping



Key cultural principles:

* epistemic humility 
* embracing anomalies that help us understand the limitations of established paradigms
* playful experimentation
* cross-status collaboration, and hearing neglected voices
* servant leadership rather than managerial control

This aligns with complexity-aware governance models that distinguish between:
* ordered domains (where best practices work)
* complicated domains (where expert engineering works)
* complex domains (where experimentation and learning are essential)

Bricolage Labs are explicitly designed for the complex domain.

Lab heads in Epistemic Bricolage Labs function less as directors of work, and more as mentors and sensemakers:

* helping participants connect disparate insights
* narrating emerging patterns
* rotecting exploratory space from premature optimization
* translating messy learning into communicable form



Metaphorically, Epistemic Bricolage may resemble cooking more than engineering.

Engineering assumes fixed specifications, standardized inputs, predictable outputs. 

Bricolage works like cuisine: it uses diverse ingredients, local improvisation and continuous tasting and adjustment.

An anomaly is a surprising flavor.
A prototype is a new recipe.
A paradigm is a cuisine that eventually stabilizes.
